## CS145 - Movie Rating Project

Setup instructions:
- If the data folder doesn't contain a movieratepredictions folder:
  - Download data from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/movieratepredictions/data
  - unzip and place the 'movieratepredictions' folder in data
- make sure you're running Python3


NOTE: I did not write the imdb and tmdb parsing scripts. They were written by other CS 145 students, I simply used that data for my models.
